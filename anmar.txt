This file contains quick Steps for my students:

Part1: 
Finish the required setup in Google Cloud based on my pdf file instructions

Part2: 
Step 1) If you work online using Gitpod, you can just use the CI starter template 
and skip to the third point.
but if you work local, you need to create a virtual environment first:
I will name it "ls-venv" for "Love Sandwiches virtual environment"
>> python3 -m venv ls-venv
OR
>> python -m venv ls-venv

Step 2) Activate your virtual environment:
* On Windows, run:
>> .\ls-venv\Scripts\activate 
OR JUST:
>> ls-venv\Scripts\activate
NOTE: with Windows CMD >> ls-venv\Scripts\activate.bat
* On Unix or MacOS, run:
>>source tutorial-env/bin/activate

NOTE: Please DON'T forget to ignore the virtual environment folder using .gitignore file

Step 3) Install the required packages (dependencies):
>> pip install gspread OR (LMS) pip3 install gspread
>> pip install google-auth OR (LMS) pip3 install google-auth
NOTE: You can install the two packages at one time 
by combining the two pip commands into one:
>> pip install google-auth gspread

You can use the command pip freeze or pip list
to double check that the required packages are installed

Part 4) The requirements.txt file:
- Create this file:
>> pip freeze > requirements.txt
- To use/install its dependencies:
>> pip install -r requirements.txt

Part 5) Happy Coding!
